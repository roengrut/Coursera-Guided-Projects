## Deep Learning with PyTorch : Build an AutoEncoder

In these one hour project-based course, you will learn to implement autoencoder using PyTorch. An autoencoder is a type of neural network that learns to copy its input to its output. In autoencoder, encoder encodes the image into compressed representation, and the decoder decodes the representation to reconstruct the image. We will use autoencoder for denoising hand written digits using a deep learning framework like pytorch.
